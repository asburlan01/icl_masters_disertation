# Discovering Predictive Patterns: A Study of Contextual Factors for Next Generation Branch Predictors

This repository contains the text of the thesis I submitted as part of my MEng Computing (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) degree at Imperial College London. The thesis was submitted in June 2023 and is entitled "Discovering Predictive Patterns: A Study of Contextual Factors for Next Generation Branch Predictors". For a quick overview of the work, consider reading through the poster with which I participated in the 2023 NANDA Workshop (also available in this repository).
